Meele, Ranged, Magic, Summon, and Chemical?!

This mod adds a new type of class to the Terraria world, the Chemistry class!
Using nothing chemicals, reactions, and natural resources to aid them in their journey, a chemist must gather many new materials in order to keep their weapons in tip-top shape.

NEW FEATURES:
- Chemistry class of weaponry
    - "Decay" system
    - "Refinement" system
    - Custom prefixes
- New resources (TBA)
- New challenging enemies (TBA)

DECAY and REFINEMENT:
As you use a chemistry-classed weapon, its materials will slowly start to degrade.
As the weapon decays, it becomes weaker and weaker until it is simply too hard to use.
To counteract this decay, you can refine the weapons using certain materials, and as you find more chemicals to use in your travels, you can even unlock the ability to have weaponry refine itself! (TBA)
